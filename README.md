Contains all the work done with respect to Data Mining and Machine Learning Algorithms

##Latest project - Heart disease Prediction

- The purpose of the project lies in predicting if the person has heart disease or not using a collection of features from patients and healthy volunteers. All the features can be obtained by the healthcare app, so as to avoid tedious medical examinations in hospitals. Furthermore, we aim to find the most influential factors contributing to peopleâ€™s disease using exploratory data analysis, which can help in preventing serious implications to the patients in the future. We aim to explore and compare different data mining techniques to further understand the data and come up with an accurate model. Lastly, we would try to do a correlation analysis between heart disease and covid with additional relevant datasets and will show if we need to take special measures on protecting patients with heart disease.

## Models Covered
